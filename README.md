# ðŸ“Š Data Analysis Project

## ðŸ§  Objective

This project showcases a comprehensive data analysis to explore and interpret datasets. The aim is to extract meaningful insights, identify patterns, and make data-driven conclusions.

## ðŸ§© Dataset Information

The dataset includes various columns with numeric and categorical information such as IDs, dates, categories, ratings, budget, revenue, and other relevant metrics depending on the context of the project.

## ðŸ§® Steps Performed

### Data Loading & Cleaning

* Imported dataset using Python libraries like `pandas`
* Checked for and removed duplicates
* Handled missing values and ensured correct data types

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Computed descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation)
* Explored correlations between relevant numeric variables
* Detected outliers using statistical methods
* Segmented and visualized data by categories for deeper understanding

### Statistical Analysis

* Measured skewness and kurtosis to understand distribution
* Calculated percentiles and coefficient of variation (CV)
* Identified trends and patterns in key metrics

### Data Visualization

* Created scatter plots, line plots, histograms, and box plots
* Developed correlation heatmaps
* Visualized top categories and distributions using bar charts and pie charts

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

* Important relationships between variables were identified
* Outliers and trends were detected
* Data visualization helped in understanding patterns and distributions
* Provides actionable insights for decision-making

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

* Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.stats
* Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## ðŸ“ˆ Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data effectively. It emphasizes analytical thinking, statistical interpretation, and the capability to communicate insights through visualizations.
